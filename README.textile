h2. Sprang

Sprang is a small script that interacts with the "sprunge.us" command line,
terminal "pastebin" web service.

h3. Installing

You can install Sprang using "easy_install":

bc. sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
sudo easy_install sprang

h3. Getting Started

You can post text to "sprunge.us" using Sprang in one of three ways:

Via STDIN:

bc. cat /etc/issue | sprang

Using a command line argument:

bc. sprang -t "This is my text"

From a text file:

bc. sprang -f /etc/issue

If the post is successful, your code and URL will be displayed:

bc. INFO: Code: cUGX
INFO: URL: http://sprunge.us/cUGX
 
You can either copy and paste the code or URL into an email or instant message,
or you could just read out the code to your friend or co-worker.

They can quickly receive the text someone has posted using this code:

bc. sprang -g cUGX
